# 🍽️ DoorSmashOrPass

**HackUMass 2025 Submission**

A smart nutrition tracking app designed specifically for UMass dining hall students. Make informed dining decisions with real-time calorie tracking and AI-powered meal recommendations.

  - Nutritional requirements
  - Food preferences and restrictions
  - Available dining hall options for each meal
